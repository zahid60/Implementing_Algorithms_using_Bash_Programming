# Implementing_Algorithms_using_Bash_Programming
This project is based on the concept of 3 types of algorithms using Bash Programming. Here User can run any type of algorithm and can understand how these algorithms actually work. The 3 types of algorithms are CPU Scheduling Algorithms, Deadlock Avoidance Algorithms, and Memory Management Algorithms.

•        CPU ALGORITHMS –

1.        First Served Scheduling Algorithm
2.        Shortest Job First Scheduling Algorithm
3.        Priority Scheduling Algorithm 
4.        Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm

•        BANKER’S ALGORITHM AND DEADLOCK AVOIDANCE.


•        SIMULATING THE MFT AND MVT MEMORY MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES.
